# AUTHORITATIVE – New-App Creation / App Stub

This is the **source of truth** for creating a new app in RankinCo Services: scaffold (GitHub + Beacon pattern), Render services (db, api, frontend), and adding an app to an existing platform. Covers create-new-app.sh, minimal-beacon-pattern, render-create-project-and-group, and app stub vs full Beacon.

**Full doc:** [NEW_APP_CREATION.mdc](NEW_APP_CREATION.mdc) (Cursor-friendly).
