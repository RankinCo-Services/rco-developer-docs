# AUTHORITATIVE – New-App Creation / App Stub

This is the **source of truth** for creating a new app in RankinCo Services: scaffold (GitHub + Beacon pattern), Render services (db, api, frontend), adding an app to an existing platform, and **registering the app with the platform** (app definition in platform admin, manifest for developer app-stub, multi-origin launch URLs). Covers create-new-app.sh, minimal-beacon-pattern, render-create-project-and-group, app stub vs full Beacon, and the multi-app flow (draft/published, platform admin can run drafts for testing). **One platform, N app deploys:** beacon-tenant (platform) is deployed once; each new app = new app Render services only (api, frontend, app db), not a new platform. A **publish-ready app-stub** is a **new repo under RankinCo-Services org** (created by **platform team**; developers don’t push to it). It implements the 3-app model and is publish-ready (assumes platform exists; app services only) and includes **scripts or a runbook** to create and configure Render services (api, frontend, db) for self-bootstrap. **Developers** create a new app from the stub ("Use this template" or script), then work and push only in that new app repo — they never push to beacon-app-stub; only platform team has write access. **Multi-origin:** each app is a separate repo and deployment; platform stores launch_url per app; tenants open subscribed apps via launcher links.

**Derived from:** setup-new-app docs and scripts, Beacon docs/APP_STUB_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, and design discussion (multi-origin, app lifecycle, manifest, platform admin draft testing).
