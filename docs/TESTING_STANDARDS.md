# AUTHORITATIVE – Testing Standards

This is the **source of truth** for testing standards on RankinCo projects (Beacon and Beacon-based apps): lint and security lint as gates before commit/deploy, and any unit/integration test expectations and commands.

**Full doc:** [TESTING_STANDARDS.mdc](TESTING_STANDARDS.mdc) (Cursor-friendly).

**Derived from:** Beacon .cursor/skills/security-review-before-commit/SKILL.md, Beacon .cursorrules (ESLint mandatory), backend/frontend package.json (test, lint scripts), rco-developer-docs ESLINT_STANDARD.md.
