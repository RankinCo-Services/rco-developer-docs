# AUTHORITATIVE – Environment Variables and Secrets

This is the **source of truth** for environment variables and secrets used by Beacon and Beacon-based apps: backend (API), frontend (Vite), and Render. Covers required and optional vars, where they live (Render, .env), and secrets handling.

**Full doc:** [ENVIRONMENT_AND_SECRETS.mdc](ENVIRONMENT_AND_SECRETS.mdc) (Cursor-friendly).

**Derived from:** Beacon DEPLOYMENT.md, QUICKSTART, backend/src/index.ts (env reads), frontend main.tsx and api.ts (VITE_*), setup-new-app .render-secrets.example.
