# AUTHORITATIVE – Security and Compliance Review

This is the **source of truth** for the mandatory security and architecture review that runs before every commit, push, and deploy on RankinCo projects (Beacon and Beacon-based apps).

**Full doc:** [SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE_REVIEW.mdc](SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE_REVIEW.mdc) (Cursor-friendly).

**Derived from:** Beacon .cursor/agents/security-compliance.md, .cursor/skills/security-review-before-commit/SKILL.md, .cursor/references/security-rules.md, .cursor/references/beacon-architecture-rules.md, DEPLOY_WORKFLOW (steps 2–3). Security compliance report is PASS/FAIL; complementary to ESLint and deploy workflow.
